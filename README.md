### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Geraldo! Programmer and accordionist in the free time

I have a passion for solving algorithmic problems, in addition to developing APIâ€™s REST and Graphql generally using Golang. I like reading articles on Medium/Quora/TED on the most diverse topics (which sometimes go beyond technology). I am currently learning more in depth about software architecture, design patterns, SOLID and clean code, in order to improve the quality, readability and testability of my current code. When I am not reading about the most diverse subjects I am playing my accordion, an instrument that is part of my routine and I have a great determination	 in my constant evolution during these 6 years that I decided to enter the world of this instrument. I am currently finishing my degree in computer engineering at [Federal University of ParaÃ­ba (UFPB)](https://www.ufpb.br/) and working as a software engineer at [Avenue](https://avenue.us/).
