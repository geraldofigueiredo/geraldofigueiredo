### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Geraldo! Programmer and accordionist in the free time

I am deeply passionate about solving algorithmic problems and specialize in developing REST and GraphQL APIs, primarily using Golang. My interests extend beyond technology, as I avidly read articles on platforms like Medium, Quora, and TED, covering a wide range of topics. Currently, I am delving into the intricacies of software architecture, design patterns, SOLID principles, and clean code. This commitment is geared towards enhancing the quality, readability, and testability of my code.

Outside the realms of technology, I find joy in playing my accordionâ€”a constant in my routine. Over the past six years, I have approached this instrument with great determination, continually evolving within the world of music.

Alongside my passion for coding and music, I am in the final stages of completing my degree in computer engineering at the [Federal University of ParaÃ­ba (UFPB)](https://ufpb.br/). Simultaneously, I contribute my skills as a software engineer at [Avenue](https://avenue.us/).
