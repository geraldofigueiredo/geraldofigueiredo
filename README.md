## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Geraldo! Senior Software Engineer and lifelong learner

I am a Senior Software Engineer with a strong focus on backend development, specializing in Golang, Python, and cloud technologies like GCP. My professional journey has been defined by creating scalable, data-driven solutions for the financial sector, designing reliable data pipelines, and architecting robust microservices.

Currently, I work at [Avenue](https://avenue.us/), where I lead the development of investment recommendation systems, focusing on performance, scalability, and delivering tailored solutions for clients. My contributions include designing resilient systems, enhancing monitoring with custom dashboards, and driving impactful technological decisions across teams.

I hold a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Engineering from the [Federal University of ParaÃ­ba (UFPB)](https://ufpb.br/), where my thesis focused on advanced customer segmentation using clustering algorithms. I am also an avid advocate of clean code, SOLID principles, and software design patterns, continuously refining my craft to deliver high-quality, maintainable solutions.

Outside work, you can find me exploring music with my accordion or diving into articles about technology, science, and personal growth. Letâ€™s connect and collaborate on exciting projects!
